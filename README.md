# Advanced Button
A custom button node for Godot that combines textures, labels, and state management into a single button.

## Why Use Advanced Button?
Godot's default buttons are built to be modular and very raw, and they are great for their purpose. I decide to create **Advanced Button** to be a comprehensive tool to make it easier to create custom button with a lot of capabilities that may be useful for your and your projects, as it has been for me.

This plugin brings out-of-the-box features like:
- Have options for using textures, styleboxes and texts.
- Handling visual states (hover, pressed, disabled) without complex theme overrides.
- Positioning labels relative to textures (top, bottom, inside, etc).
- Managing toggle states and locking behavior.
- Even label effects, color, font etc.
